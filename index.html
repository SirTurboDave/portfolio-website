            <p>
                I'm a software engineer currently specializing in building things using Java. I work as a database administrator, but am looking forward to switching careers to focus more on building new things. While working as a DBA, I've graduated from Western Governors University with a B.S. in Software Development. Since then, I've continued to work on fun personal projects as well as develop new software for my employer.
